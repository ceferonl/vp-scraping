- **Default setup for uv-based Python projects:**
  - Only these files should be present for dependency and tool management:
    - `pyproject.toml` (all dependencies, tool configs, and ruff config under `[tool.ruff]`)
    - `uv.lock` (lockfile, always present)
  - Do **not** use `requirements.lock` (legacy, not needed with uv)
  - Do **not** use `ruff.toml` (put ruff config in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`)
  - Example ruff config in `pyproject.toml`:
    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    line-length = 88
    exclude = [".venv", "output"]
    ```
- **Always use `uv add <package>` to add dependencies**
  - This ensures dependencies are tracked in pyproject.toml and lock file is updated
  - Example:
    ```bash
    uv add polars
    uv add crawl4ai
    uv add pytest --dev
    ```
- **Do NOT use `uv pip install <package>` for adding dependencies**
  - `uv pip install` is for ad-hoc installs and does not update pyproject.toml
  - Example (anti-pattern):
    ```bash
    uv pip install polars  # ‚ùå Don't do this
    ```
- **Rationale:**
  - Keeps dependency management consistent and reproducible
  - Ensures lock file and pyproject.toml are always in sync
